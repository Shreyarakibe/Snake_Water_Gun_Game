# Snake_Water_Gun_Game

A simple Python implementation of the classic "Snake Water Gun" game against the computer.

## How It Works
- The computer randomly selects Snake (0), Water (1), or Gun (2)
- You choose your weapon by entering 0, 1, or 2
- The game determines the winner based on these rules:
  - Snake drinks Water (Snake > Water)
  - Water drowns Gun (Water > Gun)
  - Gun shoots Snake (Gun > Snake)
